# Transportation-final-project
Creating a test repository for Codeacademy Open Source course

I am a Tourism Degree student carrying out a project for Transportation Management Subject.
This project is about a study of the rejection sense to overcrowded Rodalies de Catalunya Train, especially from Hospitalet de Llobregat to la Sagrera-Meridiana stops.
