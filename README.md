# Transportation-final-project
Creating a test repository for Codeacademy Open Source course

I am a Toursim Degree student carrying out a project for Transportation Management Subject.
This project is about the study of the sense of rejection to overcrowded Rodalies de Catalunya Train, especially from Hospitalet de LLobregat to Sagrera Meridiana Stops.
